# AI-Assisted Database Group Project


## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to create an **AI-integrated database** that allows users to request information in a conversational manner rather than using traditional command-line queries. The AI component, powered by OpenAI's NLP model, will also provide **insights** into compiled data upon user request.

Our initial goal is to build a **generic template database**, which can later be specialized for industries such as **healthcare** or **education**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** – Main programming language for backend development.
- 🌐 **Flask** – Lightweight web framework for building the API.
- 🗄️ **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
- 🎨 **CSS** – Used for styling the front-end interface.
- 🤖 **OpenAI NLP Model** – For processing conversational queries and generating insights.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🗨️ AI-powered Conversational Queries** – Users can interact with the database using natural language.
- **📊 AI-generated Insights and Analysis** – The system provides data-driven insights, such as trends, anomalies, and predictions.
- **🔌 API Integration** – Built with Flask to facilitate seamless communication between components.
- **🔧 Flexible Architecture** – Can be extended for different industries.
- **📈 Data Visualization Support** – *(Future enhancement)* Graphical representation of key metrics.

## 💬 Usage Example

After running the application, users can interact with the AI by querying the database using natural language. Example:

```
User: "Show me the total sales for the last quarter."
AI: "Total sales for Q4 2024 were $250,000, showing a 12% increase from Q3."
```
